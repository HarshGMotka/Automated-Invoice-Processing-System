# Install

Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy datetime
```

- Ensure you have a JSON file (let's call it **invoice.json**) with the appropriate structure.
- Read the JSON file and parse data from JSON
- Use the [code](../db_storage/save_invoice_to_db.py) to store json data into database using `sqlalchemy`.
