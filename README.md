Developing an Automated Invoice Processing System involves several key components and steps. Here is a detailed plan outlining the main phases, tools, techniques, and architecture required for this project:

# Key Components

1.	Preprocessing
2.	Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
3.	Data Extraction
4.	Classification (if needed)
5.	Categorization and Storage
6.	User Interface (Optional)

# Architecture Overview

1.	**Input**: Scanned invoices (images or PDFs).
2.	**[Preprocessing](Documentation/preprocessing.md)**: Enhance image quality for better OCR results.
3.	**OCR**: Convert images/pdf to machine-readable text.
4.	**[Data Extraction](Documentation/data_extraction.md)**: Extract relevant fields from the text.
5.	**[Classification and Categorization](Documentation/classification.md)**: Sort invoices by vendor.
6.	**[Storage](Documentation/storage.md)**: Save extracted data in a structured format (database).
7.	**Output**: Provide an interface to view and manage invoices (optional).

# Detailed Steps

## 1. Preprocessing

**Purpose**: Enhance image quality for better OCR accuracy. 

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **OpenCV**: For image processing (e.g., noise reduction, contrast enhancement).
- **Python Imaging Library (PIL)**: For image manipulation (e.g., resizing, format conversion).

**Implementation**:
- Convert image to grayscale.
- Apply filters to reduce noise.
- Adjust contrast and brightness.

## 2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
**Purpose**: Convert the preprocessed image/pdf into text. 

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **Tesseract OCR**: Open-source OCR engine.
- **pdftotext**: Simple PDF text extraction

**Implementation**:
- Use pdftotext or Tesseract to read text from the preprocessed image.

## 3. Data Extraction
**Purpose**: Extract specific fields such as invoice number, date, total amount, and vendor name from the text. Tools and 

**Techniques**:
- **Regular Expressions**: For pattern matching and extracting relevant information.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** libraries like spaCy or NLTK.

**Implementation**:
- Define regular expressions for each field.
- Parse the text using these expressions to extract required information.

## 4. Classification (if needed)
**Purpose**: Classify invoices if there are multiple types or formats. 

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use models like SVM, Random Forest, or neural networks for classification.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and training classification models.

**Implementation**:
- Train a classifier with labeled data.
- Use the classifier to predict the type or format of new invoices.

## 5. Categorization and Storage
**Purpose**: Categorize invoices by vendor and store the extracted data. 

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **Databases**: SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases.
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** tools like SQLAlchemy.

**Implementation**:
- Categorize invoices based on the extracted vendor name.
- Store extracted information in a structured format in the database.

## 6. User Interface (Optional)
**Purpose**: Provide an interface for users to view and manage invoices. 

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **Web Frameworks**: Django, Flask for web applications.
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, or Vue.js.

**Implementation**:
- Develop a simple web interface to display invoices and their details.
- Provide options to search, filter, and manage invoices.
